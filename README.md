## Loading csv Files into Database

I used pgadmin to upload csv files to database & Used create table query to create table  with specified columns & import function  to import all data to tables.
To upload analytics table I have used psql copy command.

## Data Cleaning

After I have all data in pgadmin, imported to tables. I used select * command on all tables to familiarize myself with all data, columns etc. This also helped me to find out which columns can be my primary key from any particular table. Helped me to understand relations between tables.  It gave me a good understanding of data I was going to work with overall.

## Starting with Questions
SQL Queries to all asked questions

## Starting with Data
More possible questions and SQL queries to answer those questions    

## QA Your Data
Done Data Validation using different techniques. Used various queries to support.

Generate the ERDLoading Your Final Table Into PostgreSQL Database

## Project/Goals

Once I have data, My goal was to first copy everything to database, clean all tables, Did data cleaning & validation, so data can be used in meaningful way. Its very important to remove data so database can be used more efficiently. 

## Process
## Your step 1 : 
        Clean all Data  + Validate Data
## your step 2 :
        SQL Queries for questions in the project & customized questions. 

## Results: 

Used various SQL queries to extract data from different tables, with the help of different operators, functions, joins and psql commands, sub queries. 

## Challenges: 
Copying analytics table to database. As I was using pgadmin but this table contained more than four hundred thousand rows. Finally used copy command to copy data. Even fetching data from that table was time-consuming. 

## Future Goals:
Execution of more complex queries to retrieve data from tables. 

## Results
i used diffrent SQL queries to extract data from database like information on Products sold, units in stock, price per unit, total number of unique visitos, finding all duplicate data, sales for a particular country, city with high transaction revenue level, average products ordered,, pattren in produts & many more information like this.
